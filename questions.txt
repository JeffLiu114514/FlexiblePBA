1. why do you need refine function? Wouldn't closing the gap between levels cause ambiguity at the boundary?
2. what exactly are tmin and tmax? They are called write_level_low and write_level_high in your README.md. Do we need to keep
   both read and write ranges non-overlapping? Don't we have a precise write center c?
